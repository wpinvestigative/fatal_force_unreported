Each agency will use grant funds to update the technology and equipment which will allow officers to efficiently maintain and share vital law enforcement information. These updates in equipment provide for increased officer and public safety and improved department efficiency. Although the manner in which these funds will be used makes it difficult to assess program effectiveness through increased arrests, crimes prevented, etc., it is reasonable to expect that police services will be provided more proficiently with the aid of enhanced technology and updated equipment. The goals of the involved agencies are to improve the overall level of public safety and officer safety using the equipment purchased with this grant.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that reported to NIBRS as of 2015, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2017 Phase V solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the largest agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist these agencies to transition to NIBRS reporting or to develop a comprehensive plan for transitioning to NIBRS reporting via the state pipeline. Specifically, funding under this solicitation targeted the NCS-X sample of agencies with 750 or more sworn officers that are not currently reporting crime data to NIBRS. 

Under this award, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office will engage in a multiyear project to define the NIBRS reporting requirements for a new RMS and procure and implement this RMS. At the end of the two year period, ACSO will be certified with the FBI as NIBRS compliant.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them in their transition to NIBRS reporting. 

Located in Orange County (CA), Anaheim PD serves a population of 354,000 with 408 sworn officers.  It reported 23,873 Part 1 crimes in 2017 and is the 10th most populous city in California. Currently, APD uses a commercial RMS that has the tools & structure needed to report NIBRS formatted data (to the federal standard).

Under this funding announcement, BJS, in partnership with the FBI, seeks applications for funding to enable small and medium local LE agencies in the NCS-X sample those agencies with fewer than 750 or more sworn officers that are currently not reporting incident-based data to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to report crime data to the FBIs NIBRS, either through their state UCR Program or directly to the FBI.

The FY2016 Phase III solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the largest agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist these agencies to transition to NIBRS reporting or to develop a comprehensive plan for transitioning to NIBRS reporting via the state pipeline. Specifically, funding under this solicitation targeted the NCS-X sample of agencies with 750 or more sworn officers that are not currently reporting crime data to NIBRS. 

LAPD currently reports Summary data through the state UCR Program; they have already begun the process of moving toward NIBRS-compliant incident based reporting. As part of this effort, they intend to replace their current RMS. Accordingly, they are engaging in a two-phased approach to transitioning to NIBRS reporting by first planning for the modernization through the NIBRS structure and then implementing NIBRS reporting to the new RMS that will enforce the NIBRS validation rules and data edit checks. 

As part of the planning phase, LAPD intends to pull together an executive steering committee to examine current practices and agency needs over a 6 month period to determine what kind of RMS needs the agency has. Through a competitive RFP process, the agency will acquire a new RMS and pilot/implement that new system in one of the 21 patrol divisions within the agency. This roll out phase will also include training staff on how to utilize the new system and monitoring for errors. 

To support efforts in the planning phase, the LAPD will use funds from the current award for: 1) hardware¬óservers and processors to run the new RMS; 2) mobile printers and tablets; 3) training and technical assistance provided by the new RMS solution provider; and 4) services from the RMS solution provider for database configuration to support full implementation.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them transition to NIBRS reporting. 

Santa Clara Police Department (SCPD) is working with Hexagon to build and configure the NIBRS-compliant WebRMS and Field-Based Reporting (FBR) applications. Hexagon has assured that the WebRMS application will be configured to collect federally mandated NIBRS data upon go-live. Additional professional services will be required to make the WebRMS compliant with California-specific IBR CANIBRS and to validate and submit NIBRS data to the state.

The City of Santa Clara will rely upon vendor provided end-user training utilizing a train-the-trainer method to teach SCPD staff how to collect, audit, and submit NIBRS and CANIBRS reports.

Additionally, the agency has obtained $3 million specifically towards a new computer aided dispatching and records management system (CAD/RMS) that will improve the agency¬ís ability to collect a number of the required IBR/NIBRS data elements. These funds have already been dedicated to the project, and the necessary work to transition to the Hexagon product is well underway with an anticipated go-live date in November 2018.  Because the CA DOJ has not yet announced data elements for CIBRS, Hexagon is not yet able to incorporate those elements into the RMS or build an interface for submitting the data. The agency needs to contact for professional assistance from both Hexagon and the City¬ís contract vendor for technical support for these activities.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,300 agencies that reported to NIBRS as of 2013, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2016 Phase III solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the largest agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist these agencies to transition to NIBRS reporting or to develop a comprehensive plan for transitioning to NIBRS reporting via the state pipeline. Specifically, funding under this solicitation targeted the NCS-X sample of agencies with 750 or more sworn officers that are not currently reporting crime data to NIBRS. 

The LASD is in the process of updating their customized RMS ¬ñ LARCIS ¬ñ to support reporting by patrol field units and to capture NIBRS-required information. Presently, deputy sheriffs complete incident reports on paper, which are then entered into LARCIS by station personnel. Internal staff and software engineers will modify LARCIS to be NIBRS compliant by: (1) adding/modifying fields to capture NIBRS data gaps, (2) creating a data staging schema with translation tables, and (3) building an interface to extract, translate, and load the IBR data. Funds are needed to support the technical staff and contractors modifying LARCIS and for database disk storage.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them transition to NIBRS reporting. 

Merced County Sheriff¬ís Office has 85 sworn & 35 civilian personnel, and serves a population of 250,000.  MCSO had 61,000 dispatched calls for service in 2017, resulting in 59,365 incident reports. MCSO is not part of a consortium; it hosts its own Tyler (NWS) Brand Police RMS. The NWS RMS in use by MCSO is not currently NIBRS-capable but can be upgraded by Tyler to become NIBRS-compliant. Tyler (NWS) has NIBRS capable system in other states. Under this award, MCSO will utilized $25,000 in grant funds to make its RMS NIBRS-compliant, and $5,000 for a new server to support the upgraded RMS.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them transition to NIBRS reporting. 

The Napa Police Department (NPD) has historically used Hexagon/Intergraph¬ís ILEADS records management system (RMS). However, ILEADS is nearing its product end of life date, such that ILEADS will no longer be enhanced and/or updated by the vendor. NPD must seek a new RMS product in order to become NIBRS compliant.  The NPD is part of a multi-agency consortium that shares a RMS with the Napa Sheriff¬ís Department and its contract agencies. Any transition to a NIBRS compliant RMS system will include the partner agencies. 

Utilizing grant funds, NPD will evaluate the current RMS system needs, release an RFP to find a new RMS product, and implement the chosen software. This will mitigate a serious issue identified during the NCS-X readiness assessment by the NCS-X team, which revealed the ILEADS RMS does not have the ability to report NIBRS data in the current configuration. NPD subject matter experts, along with a qualified contractor, will work closely with BJS, the NCS-X implementation team, and the state UCR Program to align the RMS with both California and national reporting requirements.  

The applicant is requesting $1,008,000 in total:
¬ï	$8,000 allocated to offset server costs,
¬ï	$800,000 for the NIBRS module of the new RMS, and 
¬ï	$200,000 for contract technical support for acquiring and implementing the new RMS.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,300 agencies that reported to NIBRS as of 2013, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2016 Phase III solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the largest agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist these agencies to transition to NIBRS reporting or to develop a comprehensive plan for transitioning to NIBRS reporting via the state pipeline. Specifically, funding under this solicitation targeted the NCS-X sample of agencies with 750 or more sworn officers that are not currently reporting crime data to NIBRS. 

The Long Beach Police Department currently uses an RMS provided that does not have the capability to report NIBRS data. However, the agency is interested in transitioning to an RMS that can. Under the current award, the agency plans to engage in a multiphase transition in which they will evaluate their current RMS based on operational and data needs, determine whether to purchase a new RMS or enhance their existing system, select a new RMS (if applicable), and deploy the new or modified system in  order to begin submitting NIBRS data. Funds will be used to acquire a consultant to evaluate their current system and provide recommendations for how they would proceed. They will also utilize funds to acquire the NIBRS module from their eventual vendor.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them in their transition to NIBRS reporting.

Under this funding announcement, BJS, in partnership with the FBI, seeks applications for funding to enable small and medium local LE agencies in the NCS-X sample those agencies with fewer than 750 or more sworn officers that are currently not reporting incident-based data to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to report crime data to the FBIs NIBRS, either through their state UCR Program or directly to the FBI.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them in their transition to NIBRS reporting. 

Contra Costa County SO (CCCSO) serves a population of 1.15 million with 697 sworn personnel. In 2017, it responded to 381,392 dispatched calls for service resulting in 16,548 incident reports and 1,617 Part 1 UCR offenses.  CCCSO shares a RMS with Pittsburg PD & Oakley PD, in addition to 3 contract cities (Danville PD, Orinda PD, Lafayette PD).  The shared RMS has the required components to report to the federal NIBRS standard however, none of the functionality is currently active in the system. Funds from the current award will be used to modify the system to activate all of the NIBRS required elements and validation rules as well as to structure the RMS to report data to the CA-state specific IBR standard once that is finalized.

Under this funding announcement, BJS, in partnership with the FBI, seeks applications for funding to enable small and medium local LE agencies in the NCS-X sample those agencies with fewer than 750 or more sworn officers that are currently not reporting incident-based data to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to report crime data to the FBIs NIBRS, either through their state UCR Program or directly to the FBI.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them transition to NIBRS reporting. 

Riverside County Sheriff¬ís Department (RCSD) is located in the 4th largest county in California, covering more than 7,300 square miles and policing 17 of the 28 cities in Riverside County. Riverside County has an estimated population of 2.4 million residents.

Currently, the agency utilizes an antiquated system that is unable to meet the required NIBRS standards. The department does not even utilize an electronic report writing system; therefore, all data are entered manually into their record management system (RMS). RCSD is going through the competitive process for procuring a new integrated computer aided dispatch and RMS (CAD/RMS) that will be NIBRS compliant. The selected vendor is slated to provide a mobile report writing module that will integrate the CAD data with the RMS data and provide an automated tool for patrol personnel to collect incident information. RCSD is requesting funds for the NIBRS component of the new RMS (based on quotes received through their competitive procurement process) and for hardware to support the new system.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them transition to NIBRS reporting. 

Tehama County Sheriff¬ís Office (TCSO) has 89 sworn officers and 35 civilians, serving a population of 63,000.  The agency processes approximately 7,000 incident reports per year. TCSO currently has an electronic record management system (RMS), and the RMS currently incorporates most of the required NIBRS data elements.  However, the agency¬ís submissions to the state UCR program are not automated; they submit their UCR crime data via paper reports.  

TCSO will need several updates to its current RMS to be fully NIBRS compliant. Funding under this award will help the agency perform a gap analysis between the current system specifications and the NIBRS requirements and implement the necessary software modifications to be come IBR compliant.

Under this funding announcement, BJS, in partnership with the FBI, seeks applications for funding to enable small and medium local LE agencies in the NCS-X sample those agencies with fewer than 750 or more sworn officers that are currently not reporting incident-based data to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to report crime data to the FBIs NIBRS, either through their state UCR Program or directly to the FBI.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them transition to NIBRS reporting. 

Garden Grove PD supports a population base of 200,000 with 167 sworn officers. The agency processes 75,000 incidents, including 7,000 arrests, per year. It is the 5th largest city in Orange County, CA. NIBRS reporting capacity is not currently included in the agency¬ís Spillman RMS. Upgrades will be needed for GGPD to be able to report NIBRS/IBR data to the State.

GGPD is requesting $450,000 to support its vendor, Spillman, to update the current RMS to be state-IBR/NIBRS compliant. The project is a relatively straightforward technical update to the RMS. The application timeline anticipates a NIBRS transition by Oct 1, 2019.

Under this funding announcement, BJS, in partnership with the FBI, seeks applications for funding to enable small and medium local LE agencies in the NCS-X sample those agencies with fewer than 750 or more sworn officers that are currently not reporting incident-based data to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to report crime data to the FBIs NIBRS, either through their state UCR Program or directly to the FBI.

CA0371100,San Diego Police Department,CA,City of San Diego,2016-FU-CX-K060,San Diego,,CA,BJS FY 2016 National Crime Statistics Exchange (NCS-X) Implementation Assistance Program: Phase III - Support for Large Local Agencies,"The National Crime Statistics Exchange (NCS-X) is an effort to expand the FBI¬ís National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) into a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics. BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,300 agencies that reported to NIBRS as of 2013, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2016 Phase III solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the largest agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist these agencies to transition to NIBRS reporting or to develop a comprehensive plan for transitioning to NIBRS reporting via the state pipeline. Specifically, funding under this solicitation targeted the NCS-X sample of agencies with 750 or more sworn officers that are not currently reporting crime data to NIBRS. 

The San Diego Regional NIBRS Transition Project is designed to enable NIBRS reporting by the San Diego Police Department (SDPD) and the San Diego County Sheriff¬ís Department, through the Automated Regional Justice Information System (ARJIS). Under the current award, the grantee will engage in two primary initiatives: 1) SDPD implementation of a NIBRS-compatible police record management system; and 2) ARJIS implementation of NIBRS reporting capabilities for local San Diego agencies that provide data to ARJIS through the NIBRS compatible interface. This system has already been implemented by multiple agencies in the San Diego region, including the similarly sized San Diego County Sheriff¬ís Department, providing evidence that the solution is a product that can serve the needs of a large law enforcement agency and can meet strict ARJIS data validation requirements.  SDPD can leverage project plans and lessons learned by other local law enforcement during their system implementations, facilitating a smoother and less risky transition in a shorter timeframe.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them in their transition to NIBRS reporting. SFPD has a home-grown RMS, called Crime Data Warehouse (CDW), that feeds into 40 other partner agencies. For example, arrests alone are updated nightly to 10 different systems. CDW is not currently NIBRS compliant: it misses expected IBR offense codes, response categories, as well as edit rules & validations. Using funds provided under this award, SFPD will perform an extensive business analysis to determine how to convert its 2,000 incident codes (in CDW) into the Offense Codes used by NIBRS.  They will then integrate the NIBRS data with the functioning of the rest of SFPD¬ís system, and with all of its partner agencies to become NIBRS compliant.

NCS-X seeks to transition a select sample of 400 LE agencies from across the country, including all of the largest agencies, to NIBRS, in order to use NIBRS data to generate national crime statistics. Under this funding announcement, BJS, in partnership with the FBI, seeks applications for funding to enable small and medium local LE agencies in the NCS-X sample those agencies with fewer than 750 or more sworn officers that are currently not reporting incident-based data to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to report crime data to the FBIs NIBRS, either through their state UCR Program or directly to the FBI.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them in their transition to NIBRS reporting. 

San Joaquin County Sheriff¬ís Office (SJCSO) serves a population of 177,000 with a force of 310 sworn officers.  In a typical year, SJCSO receives 140,000 calls for service resulting in 21,200 reports. SJCSO uses a commercial RMS which is not currently configured to report IBR data. Funds from this award will be used to update the RMS to allow it to collect data to the federal NIBRS standard, as well as modifying it to allow for the CA-specific elements.

Under this funding announcement, BJS, in partnership with the FBI, seeks applications for funding to enable small and medium local LE agencies in the NCS-X sample those agencies with fewer than 750 or more sworn officers that are currently not reporting incident-based data to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to report crime data to the FBIs NIBRS, either through their state UCR Program or directly to the FBI.

BJS and the FBI are implementing NCS-X with the support of other Department of Justice agencies, including the Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of NCS-X is to enroll a sample of 400 scientifically selected law enforcement agencies to submit data to NIBRS; when these 400 new NIBRS-reporting agencies are combined with the more than 6,600 agencies that currently report to NIBRS, the nation will have a nationally representative system of incident-based crime statistics drawn from the operational data systems of local police departments. These incident-based data will draw upon the attributes and circumstances of criminal incidents and allow for more detailed and transparent descriptions of crime in communities. The current mechanism by which local law enforcement (LE) agencies report data to the FBI¬ís NIBRS, in general, is for local LE agencies to submit data to their state UCR reporting program, and then for the state UCR program to report those data to the FBI. While the FBI does accept NIBRS data directly from a small number of law enforcement agencies, the highly preferred route of reporting is through the state UCR program. The FY2018 solicitation furthers the goals of the NCS-X initiative by providing funding to the remaining states and local agencies in the NCS-X sample in order to assist them transition to NIBRS reporting. 

The city of San Jose oversees a population of over 1 million residents. Currently, all crime reporting is in SRS format only.  Grant funds will be utilized to hire a consultant to conduct code table validation, develop scope, timeline, identify training needs, and overview for the Department¬ís transition to NIBRs.
